## Contiguous Movement

Contiguous movement is the movement of your curser between contiguous groups of cells, such as to the end of a row or end of a column. It is useful when you need to quickly jump to the end of a column or row of a large spreadsheet without having to scroll all the way through several thousand rows or mouse over several dozen columns.  To select the end of a contiguous row or column of data simple use Shift + Arrow keys

Keyboard Combination | Key | Movement
------------ | ------------- | -------------
**->** | Shift + Right Arrow | Move to the right most contiguous cell in the row
**<-** | Shift + Left Arrow | Move to the left most contiguous cell in the row
**↑**   | Shift + Up Arrow | Move to the top most contiguous cell in a column
**↓**   | Shift + Down Arrow | Move to the bottom most contiguous cell in a column

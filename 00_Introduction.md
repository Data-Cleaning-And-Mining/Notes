# Why It Matters

Learning how to efficiently utilize Excel to clean and maniplate data can make you an invaluable employee. Wasted time and energy spent trying to fight Excel can leave you and your employer unhappy with your performance and your client unsatisfied with shoddily put together work product and a high bill. This guide is intended as a collection of notes and examples on how you can use Excel better and faster in order to improve your job performance.

Before you jump into the nuts and bolts of using Excel, take a minute to ensure that you have set yourself up for success. Using Excel effectively begins with making sure you have your workstation set up correctly and understand the basic terminology of the program you are about to learn.

## Setting Up Your Workstation

The key to using Excel effectively begins with the hardware and peripherals used at your workstation. Excel is a Microsoft product, and as such has been designed to run on a Personal Computer. Excel for macintosh based operating systems does exist, but does not function the same as Excel for PC. Odds are, if you are reading this you are most likely using a PC. You may be using Excel on a PC directly, or you may be using a Macintosh computer as the means to remotely connect to a physical or virtual PC machine. For those of you not using a PC, an attempt has been made to give you the equivalent keyboard commands and steps to use on your own computer.

### Maximizing your screen real estate

While laptop computers are great for portability, they can be a pain when trying to manipulate data stored in a large Excel file. Screen real estate refers to how much space you have on the monitor(s) you are using to run your programs. Most data mining and data manipulation tasks will involve transfering data between worksheets, files, and programs. This means that you will have multiple programs and files open simultaneously on your machine. Having the screen real estate to keep these windows open without having to minimize and reshuffle the windows is paramount to working efficiently. It is highly suggested that when performing data mining and data manipulation your setup consists of at least two monitors, if not more. One monitor should be large enough to display large Excel files in a resolution satisfactory to your liking. A large 25"-32" desktop monitor is well suited to this task. Your secondary monitor can be used for those files, programs, or browser tabs on which you are not actively working. Anything that does not require your active focus can remain open on this secondary monitor, such as your Microsoft Teams application or a document from which you are cutting and pasting the data you are currently manipulating in Excel. 

For most data tasks you do not necessarily need a high end, top-of-the-line monitor. Any monitor that displays an image comfortably and at a high enough resolution will work fine. Repurposed old flat screen televisions with an HDMI input will work on most PC laptops and computers. For Macintosh computers you may have to purchase an adapter cable to make a secondary monitor work.

### Using the proper a keyboard and mouse

Most tasks that you will be expected to do in Excel presume that you are working from a full size keyboard with a numkey pad and a separate mouse. A smaller keyboard and/or the use of a trackpad on a laptop will give you a severe disadvantage when attempting to use Excel for large data manipulation tasks. This is especially true of not using an external mouse and relying on your trackpad. Using a trackpad to perform data mining and data manipulation in Excel is like running a marathon with a pair of flip-flops. With just a trackpad you will be left frustrated with the performance of your devices, and your work will be woefully inefficient. Ideally your peripherals should consist of a full size keyboard with a number pad and a three button mouse with a scroll wheel.

## Basic Excel Terminology

Understanding basic Excel terminology is important in communicating with your team and coworkers.  Understanding the specific terminology used by Microsoft in its documentation and support on Excel will help you immensely in troubleshooting and learning the nuances of Excel. Be aware that there are also many more colloquial and more common terms used in lieu of the terms used below, so make sure you know your audience and what terms are familiar to them when communicating with your team on projects involving the collaborative use of Excel.

* Cell - An individual cell is where data is stored in a spreadsheet in Excel
* Workbook - An individual Excel file, typically a file containing the file extension of type ".XLSX"
* Worksheet - Worksheets are the individual sheets inside of a workbook. A workbook may consist of a number of worksheets. The individual worksheets of a workbook are displayed on tabs on the bottom of a workbook. These are sometimes referred to as "spreadsheets", "sheets", or "tabs."
* XLSX file - A file extension currently used by Microsoft Excel to save Excel workbooks. An XLSX file can contain a maximum of 1,048,576 rows of information and 16,384 columns of information for a total of 17,179,869,184 cells of information per XLSX file.
* XLS file - An Excel file type capable of containing significantly fewer number of cells than the XLSX file type. This file type was phased out in 2003, but is still commonly seen.
* Delimiter - The character or punctuation symbol used to separate data that should be stored in individual cells when displayed in Excel. The "delimiter" of any given file type that is imported or pasted into Excel can either be automatically detected by Excel, or specified by the user doing the importing or pasting of data into Excel.
* CSV file - A file extension that stands for Comma Separated Value. A CSV file is a non-proprietary file type which is used to store information organized in a tabular or spreadsheet format. It uses a comma to separate values that belong in different fields (columns), and lines to separate values that appear on different rows. A CSV file will open in Microsoft Excel as a normal spreadsheet. The comma is a delimiter in a CSV file.
* TXT file - A file extension that stores information in a text format. A TXT file may or may not be organized in a tabular or spreadsheet format. If the information is organized in a tabular or spreadsheet format, then it can be imported or pasted into Excel and the data will appear in the individual cells as it was intended. A TXT file can have any delimiter that the original author of the TXT file wishes to use. Common delimiters used in TXT files are a comma (similar to a CSV file), a semicolon, a tab symbol, or a non-breaking space.
* VBA - An acronym that stands for Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications. VBA is an event driven programming language that is used across various Office programs to extend office programs by automating routine tasks, creating macros, and allowing for the creation of custom features and functions within Excel, Word, and various other Microsoft Office applications.
